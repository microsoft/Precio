### Pull Requests

Submit pull requrests to **branch *contrib***.
Pull requests to any other branch will not be accepted.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to **provide a CLA** and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment).
Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

### Formatting

Please use `cargo fmt` to format any code you submit for pull requests.

Documentation are mostly written in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
A line break is required after each full sentence.
